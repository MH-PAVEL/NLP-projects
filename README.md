# Sentiment Analysis Projects

This repository contains the NLP pipelines for three sentiment analysis projects:

1. **YouTube Comment Sentiment Analysis**
2. **Facebook Comment Sentiment Analysis**
3. **Google Review Sentiment Analysis**

Each project follows a structured NLP pipeline, including domain identification, target skills, feasibility checks, and detailed steps for data collection, processing, model development, and deployment.
